Anesthesia (CRNA)
Registered nurses who are experienced and comfortable working in critical care areas may become registered nurse anesthetists. This program requires graduation from an approved baccalaureate program of nursing as well as a valid nursing license. Consult the School of Nursing to determine additional requirements.

Dentistry
A bachelor's degree is now a prerequisite for entrance to most dental schools. Students may major in the field of their interest, but those with low ACT (American College Test) or SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores should seriously consider majoring in a science area. Although a thorough background in the biological and physical sciences is essential to the study of dentistry, a broad educational background in the humanities is desirable. Students are strongly encouraged to take upper-division biology courses to prepare for the Dental Admissions Test and for the first two years of basic science courses in dental school.
Application to dental school should be made one year previous to the year for which admission is desired. Successful applicants should have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.40 in both science and non-science courses as well as satisfactory performance on the Dental Admissions Test. Early application is strongly encouraged. Information regarding the Dental Admission Testing Program may be obtained from the American Dental Association, 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 69611 or on the web at www.ada.org.

Law
Students interested in the study of law as a profession will want to become acquainted with the entrance requirements of several different law schools in order to plan a preprofessional program that will qualify them for admission to multiple desired schools.
In general, students must complete a bachelor's degree before entering law school. Although no particular major is required, students who are serious about law school want to especially consider the following five fields: business, history, English, journalism, and behavioral science. All law schools recommend certain courses, including American history, freshman composition, principles of accounting, American government, principles of economics, English history, business law, and mathematics. Southern Adventist University offers a political economy minor, which combines an interdisciplinary selection of courses helpful in preparation for law school. Pre-law students should concentrate on developing their analytical, verbal, and writing skills.
To obtain information about preparing for law school, write to the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, American Bar Association, 1155 East 60th Street, Chicago, Illinois 60637. For information about the Law School Admissions Test, see the pre-law adviser.

Medicine
Secondary school students who look forward to a career in medicine will want to include as many mathematics and science courses as possible during their high school years.
Most medical schools include completion of a bachelor's degree as an entrance requirement, and applicants for admission to prestigious medical schools such as the Loma Linda University (LLU) School of Medicine will want to maintain a grade point average of at least 3.50 in both science and non-science courses. Pre-medical students are encouraged to make appointments to speak with representatives from LLU, who visit the campus once or twice each year to interview prospective students.
To give Southern students the opportunity to obtain valuable patient-care experience, the Biology Department collaborates with Chattanooga's Erlanger Medical Center in a premedical preceptorship program. This program allows upper-division students to shadow resident physicians in the hospital.
Pre-med students should complete all required science courses in time to ensure maximum performance on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), which is required by the admissions committee of most medical schools. For entrance into medical school following graduation, students should plan to take the MCAT by the September preceding their senior year. To register for specific dates, see the aamc.org/mcat website. Early submission of applications is encouraged.
Since most medical schools are members of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCA.S.), applications must be submitted through this service. The AMCA.S. application is available between May 1 and November 1 for entry into medical school the following year (aamc.org). Early in June is the optimal time to submit the AMCA.S. application, which may be obtained from the university's Counseling and Testing Services office or directly from AMCA.S., or filled out electronically online.

Optometry
The admission requirements to colleges of optometry vary, so students should follow the current catalog from their school of choice. (See the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry's website at opted.org for a list of accredited optometry programs.)
All colleges of optometry place emphasis on biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. Additional courses in the areas of fine arts, language, literature, and the social sciences are usually necessary. A minimum of two years of preoptometry study is required, and additional study increases the prospects of acceptance into professional training. The American Optometric Association (aoa.org) welcomes direct individual inquiries.

Osteopathic Medicine
Osteopathic medical schools, whose graduates receive the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree, are an alternative to allopathic medical schools, which grant the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Many Seventh-day Adventists have attended the University of Health Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine in Kansas City, Missouri, one of 19 osteopathic medical colleges in this country. Several pre-med graduates have also studied at DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine in Tennessee. Requirements for admission are similar to those for allopathic medical schools, such as Loma Linda University School of Medicine. 
Pre-med majors apply to schools of osteopathic medicine through the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMA.S.) (aacomas.aacom.org). For a reasonable chance of acceptance, students need to maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.30 in both science and non-science subjects.

Pharmacy
Students interested in a career in this lucrative field may take their prepharmacy classes at Southern Adventist University before pursuing a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy degree (PharmD). Analysts expect a shortage of qualified pharmacists as the general population ages, which has produced more competition for the available positions in pharmacy schools. The average grade point average (GPA) for accepted students is trending upward toward 3.50. In addition, many schools require a satisfactory score on the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT).
Prepharmacy requirements take from two to four years to complete, depending on the pharmacy school and the student, and many pharmacy schools are now giving admissions preference to students with a bachelor's degree. Admission requirements to colleges of pharmacy vary, so students should consult the catalog or website of the school of their choice to determine specific course requirements. The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (www.aacp.org) maintains links to all schools of pharmacy. Since pharmacy involves the study of the action of drugs in the body, students need to be especially familiar with organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology; all schools place a high emphasis on chemistry and biology. Since Loma Linda University reviews this program after Southern's catalog has been printed, students who wish to apply there should review changes at pharmacy.llu.edu.

Podiatric Medicine
Podiatric medical schools, whose graduates receive the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) degree, provide an alternative to allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) medical schools. Podiatrists are physicians who are trained in the medical and surgical treatment of the human foot and ankle.
Acceptance to a school of podiatric medicine requires a minimum of 90 semester hours of preprofessional coursework, and completion of a bachelor's degree is highly desired. Most DPM schools require the same prerequisite science classes as the MD and DO schools, and applicants must submit their results from the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT).
Of the seven colleges of podiatric medicine, six participate in the American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine Application Service (AACPMA.S.). The six schools in the AACPMA.S. are located in California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. An application packet can be obtained through the website (www.e-aacpmas.org).

Pre-Physician Assistant
Physician assistants (PAs) work in a variety of practice settings and specialty areas, including physician offices, hospitals, and clinics. Trained to perform many of the essential tasks involved in patient care, they take medical histories, perform physical evaluations, order laboratory tests, make preliminary diagnoses, prescribe appropriate treatments, and recommend medications and drug therapies. Physician assistants also treat minor problems such as lacerations, abrasions, and burns. Specialties using PAs include family practice, internal medicine, general and thoracic surgery, emergency medicine, pediatrics, and various medical sub-specialties.
Entrance requirements to PA clinical programs vary considerably, but schools generally require a baccalaureate degree in science. Requirements for patient-care experience range from professional recommendation to two years of direct clinical work experience. Southern Adventist University can structure a course of study to meet the requirements of any clinical program if students, early in their academic studies, gather information on prospective PA schools and the prerequisite coursework required.
Seventh-day Adventist schools offering the physician assistant degree are Kettering College of Medical Arts (kcma.edu), Loma Linda University (llu.edu), and Union College (ucollege.edu/pa). Students may obtain information on these programs from the Southern Adventist University pre-PA adviser or by contacting the schools directly. A complete list of physician assistant programs can be found on the American Academy of Physician Assistants website (aapa.org).

Veterinary Medicine
Professional training for veterinary medicine involves four years of veterinary school beyond college. Since competition for admission to colleges of veterinary medicine is intense, most successful applicants have surpassed the minimum requirements and completed a bachelor's degree. Pre-vet students must make a satisfactory score on the Veterinary College Admission Test (VCAT) or Graduate Record Exam (GRE) in addition to meeting grade point average (often above 3.50) and personal qualifications for admission. Applicants also find it more likely to be accepted into a veterinary school located in their state of residence.
Admission requirements vary among veterinary schools, so pre-veterinary students must work closely with their advisers to assure that specific requirements for their chosen schools are met. Information on veterinary schools and applications are both available online through the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (aavmc.org).
